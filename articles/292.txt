skipper abhimanyu easwaran continued his fine form with a second successive hundred as india a reached 324 for 5 at stumps on day two of the second unofficial 'test' against bangladesh a sylhet.
veteran cheteshwar pujara (52 off 124 balls) also warmed up nicely for the upcoming test series with a compact fifty scored in just over three hours with india enjoying a lead of 72 runs at stumps.
the 27-year-old india a captain remained undefeated on 144, batting throughout the day en route his 18th first-class hundred. he hit 13 fours and two sixes during his 231-ball knock.

the ones to miss out on the day were young opener yashasvi jaiswal (12), yash dhull (17) and sarfaraz khan (0).
sarfaraz, a prolific scorer for mumbai in ranji trophy, is yet to make a mark at the india a team level. on the day, he was out nicking medium pacer sumon khan behind the stumps.
