rohit sharma lighted up the shere-e-bangla stadium on wednesday although india endured a tough five-run defeat in the second odi against bangladesh. the outcome also saw the hosts take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series and the dead rubber will be played on saturday in chattogram.
coming back to the contest, the skipper scored an unbeaten 51 off 28 balls, dragging india close to the 272-run target from a difficult position. batting at a strike-rate of 182.14, rohit's innings featured three boundaries and five maximums.
rohit walked out to bat despite injuring his left thumb earlier in the contest during bangladesh innings. rohit was then rushed to the hospital for an x-ray as the ball hit his thumb while fielding at slips. the captain during the post-match presentation ceremony confirmed that he has dislocated it but is relieved that it isn't a fracture, which allowed him to bat in the latter stage of the innings.

rohit scored 16 runs off the over and led india's charge until the final ball. he smashed mahmudallah for two more sixes in the 49th over and with 20 required off the final over, the indian skipper took his side extremely close to the target but failed to connect the final ball for a six.
