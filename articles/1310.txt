after winning toss, shakib said, "we will have a bat. looks a very dry wicket and we are always comfortable with runs on the board. important game for both teams and we will have to play our best to win against zimbabwe. they will be on a high after that win against pakistan and we will have to play our best cricket. we got one change. yasir ali comes in for mehidy hasan."
meanwhile, craig ervine said, "looking at the conditions, don't think it's gonna change too much throughout the day. beautiful weather and obviously batting first would have been our priority. we had to fly out next day (after win against pakistan) and haven't got too much time to celebrate, but we know that's the nature of the tournament. focus is on today and not trying to look too far ahead. we have one change. luke jongwe sits out for tendai chatara."
