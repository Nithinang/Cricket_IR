india will be looking to get one foot in the semi-finals by beating a strong south african team on sunday at the perth stadium. india and south africa are both unbeaten thus far in the tournament. however, while india have won both their games, south africa were unlucky to have one match washed out while being on the verge of recording a 10-wicket win.
india will be up against south africa's fiery pace attack consisting of kagiso rabada, anrich nortje and left-arm seamer wayne parnell. meanwhile, the indian bowling attack themselves will have problems of their own to deal with as they are up against a team that are thus far the only ones to score more than 200 runs in an innings in this tournament. quinton de kock, rilee roussow, david miller have all been in good form while tristaan stubbs and aiden markram can also do damage on their day.
