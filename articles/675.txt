suryakumar however failed to equal kohli's all-time india record of highest ever score by a batter of the men in blue. his unbeaten 122 against afghanistan in asia cup tops the list, while suryakumar's 111* stands fourth on the list.
‚Äúin t20, a hundred is always special but at the same time, it was really important for me to bat till the very end. hardik was telling me to bat till the 18th or 19th over, and get to a score of 185 or so. after the end of the 16th over, we had a chat about taking it deep. it was important to maximise the last few overs. have been doing the same things over and over again, in the nets and it's just coming off for me,‚Äù said suryakumar after his breathtaking knock.
