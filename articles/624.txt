former england skipper kevin pietersen opted to come out in support of cristiano ronaldo after the portugal captain launched a scathing attack on red devils manager erik ten hag before leaving old trafford to join the portugal camp for the fifa world cup 2022 in qatar. pietersen's noteworthy remark about manchester united icon ronaldo also garnered the attention of former indian skipper virat kohli on social media.
in conversation with popular british broadcaster piers morgan, the manchester united icon had made unsavoury remarks about the glazer family, former england captain wayne rooney and ex-man united defender garry neville. the 37-year-old slammed man united chiefs for showing a lack of empathy when he refused to show up on time for the pre-season training. ronaldo, who failed to record regular appearances for man united under ten hag's watch, also felt ‘betrayed’ by the club.
speaking to sky news australia host morgan, former england cricketer pietersen extended his support to ronaldo in the wake of the interview fallout. “if what he said is true about them not believing what’s been happening with this family, i can’t say whether it’s true or not, he says it is true, that’s almost unforgivable,” pietersen told morgan.

pietersen's take on ronaldo's situation at old trafford received kohli’s seal of approval. kohli appeared to have liked the post shared by the englishman on instagram. “he is a human at the end of the day, yes he’s super famous, yes he’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he’s achieved it because he’s amazing at what he does,” the former england skipper added.
hours after pietersen sympathised with ronaldo, premier league giants manchester united opted to part ways with the portugal captain. the red devils confirmed ronaldo's departure from old trafford on tuesday. the former real madrid and juventus will not return to manchester united after portugal's campaign at the fifa world cup. "cristiano ronaldo is to leave manchester united by mutual agreement, with immediate effect," the club said in a statement.
