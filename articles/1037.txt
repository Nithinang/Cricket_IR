england batter dawid malan is a doubtful starter for his side's t20 world cup semifinal against india on thursday after picking up an injury during the team's final super 12 game. malan sustained a groin injury in england's four-wicket win over sri lanka on saturday. the former world no. 1 t20i batter hobbled off the field during the sri lankan innings and did not return to bat in england's run chase.
vice-captain moeen ali said malan's injury doesn't look good. "he is a big player and has been for a number of years," ali told the bbc. "he has been one of our best players. i don't know but it (malan's injury) doesn't look great."
england, who finished second in their super 12 group 1, will clash with group 1 toppers india on thursday.
"it doesn't get bigger and better than playing india anywhere in the world because of the crowds and they are such a big side and force in cricket," ali said.
phil salt, the only spare batter in the squad, is the likely replacement if malan does not take the field.
