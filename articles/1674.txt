it happened in the 15th over of the group a match. against the fourth ball of that over, a tossed-up delivery from meiyappan, wide and outside off, sri lanka batter bhanuka rajapaksa took the aerial route, with the aim to clear deep extra cover, but was found by the man in the deep and perished. the next ball was a googly that completely bamboozled asalanka as he produced a think outside edge and the rest was completed by the wicketkeeper. on a hat-trick, meiyappan dished out another wrong 'un and dasun shanaka went for the forward press. but the ball sneaked through the gates and rattled against the stumps to dismiss the sri lanka skipper for a golden duck.
