the incident took place in the 7th over of the indian innings, when kohli and rahul scampered and completed a third run. kohli began his innings with a four off the first ball and ran three after playing a beautiful cover drive through the largest square area on the ground. the first ball of the seventh over, kohli whipped the ball against the turn and collected a boundary; however, since the ball beat the fielder just near the boundary, he was already back for the second. the next delivery, kohli hit the ball in the same area to pick up another couple of runs. the intense running got the better of kohli, who took a pause and caught his breath before resuming.

"he is such a quick runner between the wicket. always looking for the extra run. you could see that the moment he played it, he knew where the fielder was, knew the power that he had. and so, the second was always going to be on. just giving himself a little bit of a breather," gavaskar said while on air.
