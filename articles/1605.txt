former india cricketer virender sehwag was one of the most destructive batters of his time. his explosive strike rate aided by risk-laden strokes had made the cricket experts intially question him as a batter suited for test cricket. but sehwag proved himself in the longest format of the game, amassing 8586 runs at a tremendous strike rate of 82.23. in international cricket, the india opener scored more than 17000 runs and entertained the cricket fans for more than a decade. as the famous india player turned 44 on thursday, many fans and cricketers wished sehwag.
former india captain sachin tendulkar posted a heartfelt wish on twitter. both batters share cordial relations on and off the field and in his wish, tendulkar reminisced their playing days together when he used to scold sehwag for getting to batting milestones and centuries by hitting sixes.
aapke saath hote huye kahan aisa risk le sakte hain, paaji . jab 295 ka ho jaaonga , aap izaazat toh tab hi denge ..thank you very much for your wishes, the journey became much easier with you around, paaji. https://t.co/7jvoujn7b0
"chauke pe chauka maarte huye 44 par pahunch gaye. ab 44 se 50 ke liye 6 banta hai! happy birthday viru! (you reacched 44 by hitting one four after the other now want you to reach 50 with a six!)," tendulkar tweeted.
