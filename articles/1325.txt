what is new zealand without a backs-to-the-wall fightback once in a while? sri lanka, who have become a quietly confident side after the asia cup win, did leave the kiwis on the defensive after reducing them to 25/3 at the end of the powerplay phase.
india’s 179 against netherlands was the lowest total in matches at the sydney cricket ground in this world cup until this group 1 super 12 clash on saturday evening. new zealand were in danger of folding up for far less, only for glenn phillips to hit a masterly century. openers finn allen and devon conway stood out in the win over australia, but sri lankan bowlers were on a roll after both fell cheaply, misjudging the bounce rather than any pronounced seam movement.
the south africa-born phillips played an innings perfect for any format to score his second t20 international century (104—64b, 10x4, 4x6) and transform new zealand’s innings. he raised an 84-run fourth wicket partnership with daryl mitchell (22—24b, no boundaries) to repair the early damage before exploding with brilliant shots.
having scored 167/7, new zealand were in control even before sri lanka batters self-destructed, trying to force the scoring when the new template at this world cup is early consolidation due to the conditions and unpredictable bounce.
having come into bat in the third over, phillips, 25, held firm until he holed out in the final over. the effort showed when he had to go off with cramp, but he could laugh in that pain in the kiwi dugout as sri lanka had caved in by then. rash shots by the top-order—only bhanuka rajapaksa (34) and skipper dasun shanaka (35) showed some fight — meant sri lanka were dismissed for 102 in 19.2 overs, new zealand winning by 65 runs.
it could all have been so different if sri lanka had not dropped phillips on 12 (nissanka) and 45 (shanaka). a sloppy 18th over by pacer kasun rajitha, who bowled two front-foot no-balls in succession in a nine-ball over, luckily went for only 11 runs. by then the tide had firmly turned.
trent boult at 33 has picked t20 leagues over a central contract, but new zealand won’t mind his picking tournaments if it results like saturday. three strikes in a brilliant opening spell broke sri lanka’s back before he returned to take a fourth, finishing with a career-best haul of 4/13.
with five points from three games, new zealand are on course to top group 1. sri lanka, having won the asia cup, and then qualified at the world cup, are lying fifth after the second loss in three games and in danger of elimination. saturday’s capitulation does not offer much promise of a turnaround.
brief scores: new zealand 167/7 (g phillips 104, k rajitha 2/23); sri lanka 102 in 19.2 overs (b rajapaksa 34, d shanaka 35, t boult 4/13, m santner 2/21, i sodhi 2/21). nz won by 65 runs.
