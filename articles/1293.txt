like most games in this edition of the t20 world cup, drama ensued in the match between bangladesh and zimbabwe in a super 12 clash on sunday. it was a thrilling contest between both sides, as the shakib al hasan-led side registered a three-run victory in brisbane. however, in a bizarre turn of events, the players were called back after what looked like the final delivery of the match was bowled – it turned out that it was actually a no ball as wicketkeeper nurul hasan had collected the delivery in front of the stumps before knocking off the bails.
bangladesh had seemingly won the match but the final delivery was played again; it didn't change the result, though, as blessing muzarabani couldn't score a run off the free hit, eventually resulting in a close defeat for the side.
interestingly, zimbabwe's last match against pakistan was also decided on the final delivery; the result, however, favoured craig erwine's side. with pakistan requiring three runs off the final ball, the batters could only take one before shaheen afridi was run out. a video of former zimbabwe cricketer pommie mbangwa doing a charged-up commentary on the final ball of the match had gone viral, with many lauding the zimbabwean's passion.
