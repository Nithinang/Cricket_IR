england made a bold declaration in the second innings, setting a target of 343 runs for pakistan with four sessions left. but england picked two, including that of captain babar azam, at the close of day 4 and then wrapped up pakistan for 268 runs, picking the final wicket at the nick of time.

vaughan was particular impressed with stokes' captaincy as he mentioned the same in his column for telegraph as well. “i can’t think of another captain who would have forced a win on that pitch – especially in the first test of a three-match series away from home. they scored 921 runs at 6.7 an over across the match. they tried anything and everything with the ball. they declared at tea on day four, setting a target they knew pakistan would chase down if the likes of babar azam got going. that was the only way it was ever going to be possible to win a test on that pitch,” he wrote.
