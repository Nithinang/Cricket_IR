rohit who is the only active player to have featured for india in all t20i world cups so far, won the toss against babar azam and opted to field, a decision, which looks going into india's favour as pakistan lost their captain in the second over bowled by arshdeep singh. the left-arm quick rapped babar on the pads and even though the pakistan captain took the review, he had to depart as the ball tracking showed three reds.
arshdeep gave india a second success soon after as in his next over, he dismissed the in-form muhammad rizwan. the pakistan wicketkeeper batter enjoyed a bit of a lifeline as he top edged a delivery but lived as the ball dropped about just an inch in front of a diving virat kohli. however, rizwan's luck ran out as he top edged arshdeep to deep fine leg, where bhuvneshwar completed a sharp catch.
"looks like a good pitch, it's always nice to bowl with overcast conditions. think the ball will swing around a bit, and we need to take its advantage. preparations have been good. we played a couple of practice games in brisbane. time to come out and enjoy ourselves now. we were expecting nothing less than this, hopefully we'll entertain them (the crowd). we have seven batters, three seamers and two spinners," the indian captain said during the toss.
