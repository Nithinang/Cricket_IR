the sports nutritionist also stated that hydration is important in suryakumar's diet. "hydration guidelines that is fluid and electrolytes are provided for the intra-match/intra-training period. activity specific, sports performance boosting supplements are added pre, during and post training", she said.
"these include whey protein, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, joint health supplements to name a few. the basic plan is modified from time to time as per the match, training and travel schedules. i plan the menu, suggest healthy alternatives and cuisines to avoid monotony", she further added.
