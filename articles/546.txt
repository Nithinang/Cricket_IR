sanju samson was not picked in the playing xi during the three-match t20i series with captain hardik pandya explaining it to be an "unfortunate" case and "strategic" reason. he was however given a chance in the first odi earlier this week where he scored a 38-ball 36 while stitching a crucial 96-run stand alongside shreyas iyer that helped in india's revival. but samson was dropped yet again, on sunday, for the second odi to make way for greater bowling depth and the decision left fans fuming at captain shikhar dhawan and head coach vvs laxman. (india vs new zealand live score 2nd odi)
there was criticism over india featuring just five bowlers for the opening odi where the visitors lost by seven wickets. hence, india made two changes for the second match. "instead of shardul thakur, deepak chahar comes in and deepak hooda comes in place of sanju samson," said dhawan after losing the toss.

this is horrible. sanju has to sit out even after doing well in odis. what else this guy needs to do yaar. absolute favoritism.

"we would have bowled first as there's moisture in the wicket. even in the last game the wicket was seaming for the first 10-15 overs, we got to keep the positive intent and go for the runs," dhawan added after india were put to bat first. "we only need 10 percent of improvement and it makes a huge impact and especially in the death bowling, we got to be a bit more smarter."
