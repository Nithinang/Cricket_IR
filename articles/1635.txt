australia wicketkeeper-batsman josh inglis is being assessed by team medical staff after suffering a cut to his right hand in a golfing mishap on wednesday, just days before the team begin their t20 world cup title defence.
inglis, reserve to regular wicketkeeper matthew wade in their 15-man world cup squad, was injured when a club snapped in his hand during a "normal golf swing" while on a morning round with some of his team mates, a team spokesman said.
australia open their title defence against new zealand in sydney on saturday, a rematch of last year's final in the united arab emirates.
golf has already cost england the services of jonny bairstow at the tournament after he was ruled out by a freak injury while playing a round in september. the batsman slipped while out on a course and needed surgery on a broken leg and dislocated ankle.
