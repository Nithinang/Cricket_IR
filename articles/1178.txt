earlier, indian opener agarwal was appointed as the captain of the punjab-based franchise before the start of the ipl 2022. punjab kings had retained star player agarwal and pacer arshdeep singh in the lead-up to the mega auction for season 2023. dhawan, who enjoyed blockbuster success at delhi capitals (dc), was released by the rishabh pant-led side ahead of ipl 2022. dhawan amassed 618 runs at a strike rate of almost 145 for dc in the ipl 2020. the veteran indian opener was roped in by punjab kings for a whopping sum of inr 8.25 crore at the mega auction.
the stand-in skipper of team india accumulated 460 runs in 14 matches in his debut season for punjab kings at the ipl 2022. one of the finest left-handed batters in white-ball cricket, dhawan has played 161 one day internationals (odis) and 68 t20is for team india. dhawan is the second-highest run-getter in the history of ipl. the former dc opener has amassed 5,881 runs in 162 ipl matches. dhawan has also smashed the most fours (701) in the cash-rich league. the 36-year-old will lead the indian team against new zealand for the upcoming odi series, starting november 25.
