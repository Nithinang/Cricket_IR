following the match, alex hales gave an interview for sky cricket, which turned a little awkward as former england captain eoin morgan was also part of the broadcasting team, and was standing next to hales. for context, hales had failed a drug test twice ahead of the 2019 world cup and was withdrawn from the squad after being slammed a 21-day suspension. under morgan's captaincy, hales was exiled ever since and following the former captain's retirement from the game earlier this year, hales was given another chance in the english squad after jonny bairstow's unfortunate injury weeks before the world cup.
hales joined the english team for its seven-match t20i tour to pakistan and produced strong performances, and has continued his good outings in the ongoing world cup.
