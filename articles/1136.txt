low full toss from farooqi and maxwell hits it through square leg for four. that's his half century in 29 balls. just five runs off the first three balls.
aus vs afg live score: australia 159/8 in 19 overs
wow, australia's attempt to make a big push in these death overs has fallen flat on its face. a bit of a mental chess in the end of the 19th over as naveen stops almost to warn richardson for a mankad off the last ball. he comes running in and this time maxwell pulls put almost tit for tat. maxwell then hits it straight at naveen, who turns around and smashes the stumps at the non-striker's end.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: out!

aus vs afg t20 world cup live: six! maxwell just about beats rashid!
maxwell swivels around and sends fazal over deep midwicket. rashid comes running in at the boundary, catches the ball while in the air and tries to flick it back in behind him. but he ends up throwing the ball on his trailing foot and it falls beyond the boundarya.
aus vs afg live score: just three runs off the 17th!
what an over from naveen-ul-haq. singles off the second, fifth and sixth balls are all that the australian batters get from it. they are 146/5 in 17 overs

aus vs afg t20 world cup live: six!

aus vs afg live score: four!
maxwell whips it past short fine leg for his second boundary of the innings. australia are into three figures.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: six! stoinis goes up and over!
he had been the silent partner in that partnership with marsh, wonder if he is looking to take the initiative with an out of form glenn maxwell at the other end. nabi puts it nicely in his arc and he powers it over deep midwicket.
t20 world cup live score: gone! no half century for marsh!
top edge, the keeper calls for it. it is swirling around and when finally gurbaz takes the catch, he has a look of shock and relief and then indicates with hs finger that the ball was doing everything in the air. that's the end of marsh's charge, no half century for him today.
marsh c rahmanullah gurbaz b mujeeb ur rahman 45 (30), australia 86/4 in 10.4 overs
aus vs afg t20 world cup live: four! misfield from mujeeb
6, 4, 4, and mujeeb-ur-rahman with egg on his face this time. it has to be said, though, that ball was absolutely darting across the ground after marsh pulled it. however, mujeeb did get there and the ball skipped over his foot for four. the next delivery is a dot ball and australia are 78/3 in 9 overs. marsh moves to 41 off 25.
aus vs afg live score: four! marsh shifting gears
pitched up again by gulbadin and this time he goes over cover. marsh taking it to the opposition.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: six! giant from marsh!
too full from gulbadin, marsh just stands there and sends it sailing downtown. that is a long boundary but it is cleared with ease. australia get to 70 for the loss of 3 wickets in 8.3 overs
aus vs afg t20 world cup live: australia 62/3 in 8 overs
seven runs off the eighth over bowled by rashid khan. a quiet couple of overs for australia but they continue to have a strong run rate because of that swift start provided by david warner.
aus vs afg live score: dropped! marsh given a lifeline!
afghanistan could have put australia in a real tangle there. first ball of the seventh bowled by gulbadin. it is wide and outside off, marsh slashes at it and it darts to najibullah zadran at point. it bursts off his hands and goes behind him.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: out! now smith is gone!
struck on the pads! he looks completely done for there and naveen-ul-haq might just have dismissed two of australia's most succesfull batters in the same over. umpire raises his finger, smith goes for the review after a long consultation with marsh. the ball had snuck underneath his bat and taken the pads and the ball tracker shows three reds.
smith lbw b naveen-ul-haq 4 (4), australia 54/3 in 6 overs
t20 world cup live score: four! smith is off!
short and wide from naveen-ul-haq and smith puts it away. that's a bit of a freebie really, no way smith was missing out on that one.
aus vs afg t20 world cup live: gone! that's it for warner!
switch hit gone wrong! oh, warner gets himself in a proper tangle there and loses his stumps.
warner b naveen-ul-haq 25 (18), australia 50/2 in 5.2 overs
aus vs afg live score: six! first big one of the match from marsh!
half volley outside off from mujeeb for the fourth ball of the fifth, marsh slog sweeps that over long-on. sweet timing from the all-rounder.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: australia 38/1 in 4 overs
what a start this is from australia and it has been fuelled by warner. when he is not looking for boundaries, he is looking to run an extra one.
t20 world cup live score: warner putting all kinds of pressure on the fielders
australia need every run they can find today and warner seems to know it. he and marsh run two, then sees a faint glimmer of a chance and calls for the third. he then seems to be shaping up to start running a fourth as well after that.
aus vs afg t20 world cup live: four!
this outfield is laser fast, it looked like rashid khan might get to it running to his right from midwicket but the ball beats him. warner is motoring along, australia 27/1 in 3 overs.
aus vs afg live score: out! green goes!
no green rampage today! fantastic catch by gulbadin naib at slips. green slashes at it hard, gets an edge and it darts to the left of naib, he reacts swiftly and latches on to the ball.
green c gulbadin naib b fazalhaq farooqi 3 (2), australia 22/1 in 2.1 overs
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: four! warner on fire early

aus vs afg live score: four again!
back to back boundaries, warner is in the zone. slightly short from mujeeb and warner works it through backward square leg easily.

switch hit, warner reverse slog sweeps mujeeb over the in-field off the second ball of the second, one bounce and four.
t20 world cup live score: australia 6/0 in 1 over
an overthrow off the fourth ball gives australia an extra run and then two dot balls to finish the over.
aus vs afg t20 world cup live: four!
fazalhaq farooqi bowling the first over, sends an outswinger at length for the third ball and warner sends it through covers for the first boundary of the day.
aus vs afg live score: mitchell starc
the other surprising omission from the australian squad is mitchell starc. kane richardson has been brought in his place.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: cameron green
if green hits the kind of form he showcased during australia's series in india just before the t20 world cup, then finch not being available today might turn out to be a blessing in disguise. in his seven-match t20i career, green has scored 136 runs at a strike rate of 174.35.

afghanistan have won the toss and chosen to bowl first
aus vs afg t20 world cup live: toss delayed
but don't worry, there is no sign of any rain in adelaide. this is just because of the spillover of the previous match between new zealand and ireland.
t20 world cup live score: finch ruled out!
well this is just in, australia captain aaron finch has been ruled out and matthew wade will captain the team.
australia vs afghanistan live t20 world cup 2022: hello and welcome!
australia would have hoped to be in a better position here considering they are hosting this tournament and defending the title. but here they are, and the only thing they can do now, is win this match and hope for the best.
