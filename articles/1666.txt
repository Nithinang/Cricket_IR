speaking to ani, binny revealed that he was to stop the increase in injuries among players, citing bumrah's example, saying that the star bowler's back injury right before the 2022 t20 world cup has disrupted india's entire plan for australia.
â€œas the bcci president, i want to primarily focus on 2 things. first is the prevention of injuries to the players. jasprit bumrah got injured just before the world cup, which affects the whole plan.
not just bumrah, india lost deepak chahar to an injury as well before the world cup. however, the more significant aspect of chahar's injury was that he had only recently returned from another injury for which he had missed the ipl and the most of india's summer campaign. it was chahar's third injury this season.
binny also wants to improve the pitches across the country.
second, i want to focus on the pitches in the country. there needs to be more life in the wickets at home, so that our teams would not have the problem of adjusting when travelling abroad - like in australia, where there is more pace and bounce," he said.
