pakistan suffered a shocking defeat on thursday evening at the hands of zimbabwe in 2022 t20 world cup match in perth. the babar azam-led side lost by one run as they failed to chase down a total of just 131 runs, a defeat that left their world cup campaign hanging in balance and leaving them with just a mathematical chance of making the semi-final.
mohammad wasim jr and shadab khan shared seven wickets between themselves as pakistan restricted zimbabwe to 130 for eight in 20 overs. 131 was never a stiff target for pakistan, however, they lost both openers babar azam and mohammad rizwan early in the chase. shan masood was once again among the run getters and he managed to get a crucial 52-run stand alongside shadab. the partnership put pakistan on the verge of victory. but some quick wickets in the death overs and some disciplined bowling, zimbabwe gained momentum and inflicted a shocker.
