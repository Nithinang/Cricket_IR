with shah rukh khan considered to be one of the greatest actors of indian cinema, shoaib akhtar proved that the bollywood actor's influence even extends to pakistan. taking to twitter, akhtar shared a video of him conversing with some pakistan cricket fans outside his car. the ecstatic fans expressed their wishes and hopes for the babar azam-led side, who have qualified for the semi-finals, and also had some advice for the team. the best part of the video was when the former pacer was about to sign off, the fans pointed to their friend farhan, who turned out to be a srk fan.
the fan also began to mimic a dialogue of shah rukh's famous 1999 movie baadshah, but the former player had a witty response to it. he interrupted him midway, and said, "beta shah rukh khan hai, itne lambe dialogue nahi bolta, (boy, he is shah rukh khan, he doesnâ€™t say such a long dialogue)".
