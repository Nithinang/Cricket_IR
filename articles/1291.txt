rizwan is the third pakistani cricketer to complete 2,500 runs in the shortest format. pakistan skipper babar is the all-time leading run-getter for the green army in the shortest format. babar has accumulated 3,239 runs while rizwan has amassed 2,527 runs for pakistan in t20is. former pakistani all-rounder hafeez scored 2,514 runs in 119 matches for the 2009 world champions.
rizwan is also the second-quickest (65 innings) to achieve the milestone of 2,500 t20i runs. talking about the recently concluded encounter between pakistan and the netherlands, rizwan's 49-run knock and fakhar zaman's 20 off 16 balls guided the babar-led side to a comfortable 6-wicket win at perth. rizwan-starrer pakistan chased down the paltry total of 91 in 13.5 overs. pakistan's shadab khan, who took 3 wickets and leaked 22 runs, was named the player of the match.
“very happy. performed very well in the bowling and in the batting. length was crucial. everyone executed their plans. in my opinion we could chase better than this. but a win always gives you confidence. we'll try to do our best in the next matches and win,” pakistan skipper babar said after the match.
