there was a big question mark on dinesh karthik's form and fitness ahead of india's t20 world cup super 12 group match against bangladesh but he passed the fitness test on wednesday and was once again preferred over rishabh pant. in the two opportunities that karthik got before wednesday, he couldn't do much with the bat. coming in to bat at the fall of hardik pandya's wicket in the 15.1 overs when india, at 130 for 4, were in need of a good finish, karthik started off well with a nice flick for a boundary but just when he was looking set to pull off a customary dk finish, there was heartbreak for him and the near-capacity crowd at the adelaide oval.
in the last ball of the 17th over, virat kohli hit it towards extra cover and took a couple of steps. karthik set off at full pace but kohli immediately put his hand up to send him back. the veteran keeper-batter tried his best and even put in the dive to reach home but it wasn't to be. there was drama in karthik's dismissal though.

the third umpire, after watching just a few replays decided that the ball had hit the stumps before the bowler's hands and adjudged karthik run-out. replays, however, seemed to convey a slightly different story. yes, it was clear that the ball hit the stumps first but there was a lot of doubt about whether that impact actually dislodged the bails or it was the bowler's hands. nevertheless, karthik had to walk back for 7
virat kohli just ended the career of dinesh karthik......thank you dk!#indvsban
an adelaide game with virat kohli involved in a run out. we’ve seen this happen before. this time karthik at the receiving end 👀#t20worldcup #viratkohli pic.twitter.com/dm07ud4rf3
still feel umpires should have checked that run out again.i think the ball did not dislodge the stumps. it was shoriful's hands doing the work and ball was not in his handskarthik unlucky💔#indvban

the karthik run-out did not hurt india a great deal as they posted 184 for 6 after shakib al hasan put them in. kohli, who hit an unbeaten 64 off 44 balls, and kl rahul with a blazing 50 put on a key stand of 67 to lay the foundations for a strong total.
thanks to litton das' whirlwind half-century bangladesh raced to 66 for no loss after 7 overs when rain interrupted proceedings. when play resumed, bangladesh had a revised target of 151 in 16 overs, meaning they needed 85 runs in 9 overs with all 10 wickets in hand. most sides would win it from here but india made a strong come back with the ball, backed by some outstanding fielding to win the match by 5 runs.
