morrison called out the fan after pakistan secured its berth in the final of the t20 world cup 2022 on thursday. shaheen afridi emerged as the pick of the bowlers for pakistan in the first semi-final of the t20 world cup at the sydney cricket ground (scg). afridi bagged the crucial wickets of finn allen (4) and kane williamson (46) as new zealand managed to post 152-4 in 20 overs. in reply, pakistan chased down the target in 19.1 overs. mohammad rizwan (57) and babar azam's 53-run knock of 42 balls powered pakistan to a comfortable 7-wicket win over last year's runners-up at the scg.
"thanks to the crowd. we feel like we're playing at home. got a good start with the first 6 overs with the ball. later on the ball didn't come on well. fast bowlers finished well. we planned before going that we'll utilise the powerplay. he's a young guy and showing his aggression (haris). he's playing very well. we're going to enjoy this moment. but at the same time have focus on the final," pakistan skipper babar said after the match.
