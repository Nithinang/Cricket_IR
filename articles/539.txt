the weather gods have once again taken control with rain stopping play in the ongoing second odi between india and new zealand, at seddon park in hamilton. with the visitors reaching 89 for one in 12.5 overs, rain stopped play and the ground staff rushed to the field with covers. in a video posted by rajasthan royals (rr) on social media, star player sanju samson could be seen helping the ground staff with the covers and has been applauded by fans for his gesture.
the rr captain hasn't been included in the india's playing xi for the ongoing odi fixture. he was also benched for the entire t20i series, but got a chance in the first odi. in the first odi, samson registered 36 in 38 balls as india reached 306 for seven in 50 overs, setting a target of 307 in auckland. but an unbeaten century by tom latham helped the hosts successfully chase down the target with 17 balls left, winning by seven wickets.
