"the plan was clear when i went into bat. at the 12th/13th over, we thought about batting deep and getting around 170-175 was a par score. secret (behind his freak shots) is about the intent and you need to enjoy yourself. it's also about the work you do in the practice sessions. it's a great feeling coming here, having a full game and going 1-0 in the series feels good. i feel that i didn't think too much about what was happening. just had my gameplan and it worked well. fantastic crowd here," suryakumar said after the match.
