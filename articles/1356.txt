aus vs eng, t20 world cup live score: match abandoned!
rain is the winner today at the mcg, it has beaten afghanistan, ireland, england and australia. the umpires have shaken hands with the captains, a number of players are going around clicking selfies with the fans who made their way to the stadium. fair play to them for that. there was no rain for 90 odd minutes but it started pouring again and that ended any chances of any play happening. so now there are four teams in group 1 on three points and two teams on two. england are in the top two on the basis of their net run rate, new zealand remain on top, ireland are third ahead of australia on the basis of their nrr as well.
australia vs england live score: another inspection scheduled at 3.25pm ist

t20 world cup live score: returning zampa
like wade, adam zampa had also tested positive for covid-19 before australia's match against sri lanka. unlike wade though, zampa had mild symptoms and so could not play. he returns for the melbourne rain derby though.
aus vs eng, t20 world cup live score: what glenn maxwell had said
glenn maxwell had spoken with the host broadcasters a while back. here is what he said: (on stoinis's knock) it was just incredible. we know he has that sort of power but for him to come out, conditions weren't great for batting, the way he started off with that intent was outstanding. that's what we've always talked about - the middle-order trying to have an impact on the game regardless of how many balls it is and he certainly did that. the fact the was able to see it through to the end and break the fastest fifty record for australia was awesome to watch. (on his batting) i feel like i've peaked at the right time. before the tournament started, we had 15 games in six weeks and the guys were pretty tired and cooked after a lot of travel around the world. to be able to come into the tournament, hit the ball really well in the practice game and then to start off quite nice in the first two games is exciting. (on tonight's game) we are all quite galvanised by the other night knowing that no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we've got guys that can play the role and win the game from any position. we probably weren't at our brilliant best in all our three facets but we feel like we're getting closer and closer to that perfect game. i noticed that no one else was doing any wicketkeeping practice, so i thought while i was at kookaburra to grab a set of gloves. i'm pretty sure wade will be fine tonight.

t20 world cup live score: umpires talking to the captain
they are out in the middle and having a chat. could be about the revised playing conditions, could be about possibly abandoning this match, could even be about what they all had for dinner last night. we will know in a few minutes.
aus vs eng, t20 world cup live score: timely rains
melbourne has had more rains this week than the entire monthly average for october, nasser hussain had said some time back in commentary. if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

it seems that covers in the run up areas at both ends have been taken off, leading to a lot of cheers from the crowd. rain has cleared up for a while.
t20 world cup live score: australia's wicketkeeper situation
somehow, australia decided it's a good idea to come into this tournament without a backup wicketkeeper. now, matthew wade is down with covid and captain aaron finch, david warner and glenn maxwell are the names being bandied about as potential replacements behind the wicket.
aus vs eng, t20 world cup live score: cut off time
well a five-over game has to start by 9.46 pm local time or else the match will be called off. will be a real shame if it does for the 50,000-odd people who have bought tickets today.
t20 world cup live score: toss delayed!

australia vs england live score: england's irish shocker
could moeen ali have seen england over the line if there was no rain? we will never know. but, the fact remains that ireland did not deserve to lose that match and it was a just result in the end. england captain jos buttler said as much. "i think we should let it hurt. i think days like today are really, really disappointing, and you've got to feel that. there's no point in saying let's sweep it under the carpet and move on."
aus vs eng, t20 world cup live score: covers, covers everywhere
so, just over an hour remaining for the scheduled time for the toss and it is as sodden as ever at the ‘g. the ground’s all covered up, there is still time of course, but be braced for a toss delayed alert in an hour or so.
australia vs england live score: a rivalry for the ages
this is the rivalry that shaped international cricket in its primordial state. in march 1877, a combined australian xi beat james lillywhite's xi by 45 runs. this match would later be known as the first-ever test match in which australia beat england. nearly a century later, melbourne hosted yet another first, this time a 40-over match between england and australia that would later be recognised as the first limited overs match. there have been thousands of chapters to this rivalry accross the years and we are about to witness the latest one, if the weather permits.
aus vs eng, t20 world cup live score: earlier in the day…
afghanistan met ireland at the mcg. not on the cricket ground, though, in their dressing rooms. well, at least some of the players surely exchanged a few words with each other. rain reigned supreme on the cricket field, were there was a lot of to and fro-ing, covers going off and coming on, before it was finally decided to call the whole thing off.
t20 world cup live score: the wrong melbourne stadium?
if it is a world cup game, it has to be at the mcg of course but considering the rainy circumstances, would have been more prudent to hold these matches at the docklands stadium which has a roof? michael vaughan seems to think so. “rainy season in australia .. stadium in melbourne with roof on .. !!!!! wouldn’t it have been sensible to use it ??? #justsaying #icct20worldcup2022," he just tweeted.

t20 world cup live score: the rain song
the led zeppelin classic seems to be the tune for the day in melbourne. spring showers have swept through the city, which may make its residents happy but not those who love cricket in the city, or outside it. out of the four matches played thus far at the mcg, only one, the thrill-a-minute affair between india and pakistan, was left untouched by rain. among the rest, one was decided by mr. duckworth, mr. lewis and mr. stern and two others, both of them involving afghanistan, were washed out without a ball being bowled. staying on the zeppelin theme, someone needs to find a stairway to heaven and turn off the tap.
australia vs england live score: hello and welcome!
australia and england. the first two teams to play test cricket. two teams caught in a perennial rivalry played out most prominently in test cricket through the ashes but a world cup clash between them is a tantalising prospect. especially when you consider that both teams are filled with t20 superstars, most of whom who also would be seeing this match as a good time to finally come good after being largely disappointing throughout this tournament. however, there is a potential spanner in the works lurking above the cavernous mcg today. let us hope that this match won't go down the road that the afghanistan-ireland game went earlier today.
