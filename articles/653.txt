tamil nadu batter narayan jagadeesan scripted a world record on monday as he went past legendary cricketer kumar sangakkara to hit the most number of consecutive tons in the 50-over format. jagadeesan completed the achievement during tamil nadu's match against arunachal pradesh at the ongoing vijay hazare trophy, india's premier 50-over domestic tournament.
jagadeesan's explosive innings saw him score 277 off 141 balls, which included 25 boundaries, and 15 sixes. this was his fifth consecutive ton and with this he shattered sangakkara's record, who had previously slammed four consecutive tons in the 2015 cricket world cup.
apart from his colossal knock against arunachal, jagadeesan had scored 128(123) vs haryana, 114* (vs andhra pradesh), 107 (vs chhattisgarh), and168 vs goa.
