all-rounder washington sundar played a blinder while batting at no.7 in the 1st one-day international(odi) between hosts new zealand and india on friday. he hit a quickfire 37 off just 16 balls at an incredible strike rate of 231.25 to take the team total past 300. team india eventually scored 306/7 in 50 overs, as openers shikhar dhawan and shubman gill hit half-centuries each and shreyas iyer top-scored with 80 off 76 balls.
with his blazing strike rate, washington broke former india all-rounder suresh raina's record of hitting fastest 30+ score in odi by an indian player on new zealand soil. raina earlier held the record of having a strike rate of 211.11 when he hit 38 off 18 balls against new zealand in the 3rd odi of the series in 2009. washington also eclipsed kapil dev's strike rate of 206.25 in 1992.

new zealand won the toss and elected to bowl first. the india openers started off nicely as they stitched a 124-run partnership for the first wicket. after the century stand, both openers dhawan and gill were dismissed in quick succession. by the score of 160 runs, team india found themselves four down with rishabh pant and suryakumar yadav back to the pavilion. then sanju samson and shreyas iyer steadied the innings but the men in blue didn't look like crossing 300. however, a blitzkrieg by washington helped india sail past the 300-run mark.
"it really worked today, it was great to get some runs. i have to let my instincts go through, i also plans my shots, there's a program. it's important to get the timing right, along with the power. it's a par score, if we bowl well we'll be able to win this," washington said exclusively to broadcaster prime video at the end of the indian innings
meanwhile, pacers arshdeep singh and umran malik marked their odi debuts in the match.
