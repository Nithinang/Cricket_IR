ireland vs england, t20 world cup 2022 highlights: england were hardly able to get any momentum going during the chase and rains in the 15th overs sounded the death knell for them. alex hales, jos buttler and ben stokes all fell without scoring too much in the first four overs. dawid malan and harry brook also could not get the england innings going and while moeen ali looked capable of triggering an improbable fightback, it was not enough when it came down to the dls that was applied when rains came in. ireland have thus recorded a famous win, their first in the super 12 stage of a t20 world cup, and the result now throws group 1 wide open with five of the six teams now on two points.

t20 world cup live score: that's that! they shake hands, big big win for ireland!
ireland have won by five runs. what a massive win this is. not only does this seal a first-ever t20 world cup super 12 win for them, this also throws the group wide open. this win is no accident, ireland have been absolutely brilliant throughout this match. balbirnie, adair and mccarthy have gone over to the tiny but significant irish crowd where they are showered with hugs and kisses. apart from that period where they collapsed in the last five overs of their innings, ireland have been on top and england just could not get out of jail. their star-studded batting lineup are yet to do anything significant in this tournament and there is a very good chance that this defeat might just be a death knell for their semi-final spot.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: england staring into the abyss
the par score is 110 and england are behind it. the minutes are ticking down just too quickly now for them.
ireland vs england live score: rain tumbling down, the players go off!
well would you believe it, just as it looked like england might have a good over, the skies open up and it is pouring. we will start losing overs now and if it comes to mr. duckworth, mr. lewis and mr. stern, it won't be good news for england. england 105/5 in 14.3 overs, need 53 to win in 33 balls
t20 world cup live score: four! better for england
full outside off from delaney, moeen slashes an extra cover drive to the boundary. is this the over that england needed to turn this game around?
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: six! kohli-esque from moeen
kohli did that to a pacer, moeen did that to spinner delaney, makes room and and hits him downtown for six.
t20 world cup live score: gone! bad to worse for england
malan top edges a pull and is caught. england have lost half their batting lineup now.
malan c hand b mccarthy 35 (37), england 86/5 in 13.1 overs
ireland vs england live score: england 77/4 in 12 overs
well it has been a real struggle for all england batters to do anything here and it looks like ireland might just be inching closer and closer to a famous win here.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: out! third time lucky for ireland
this time ireland hold on and it is delaney who makes amends at the boundary. it is amazing just how much england are struggling despite the dropped catches from ireland and the extraordinary collapse before that.
brook c delany b dockrell 18 (21), england 67/4 in 10.5 overs
ireland vs england live score: dropped again! two in two now!
the first drop was off the first ball of the 11th, now another off the second. malan gets another lifeline, this time thanks to delaney who is not able to hold on to one running in from deep point.
t20 world cup live score: dropped! malan survives!
adair was in play at long off but he misjudges attempted lofted shot, it ends up bouncing off his outstretched hands.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: england 63/3 in 10 overs
ireland are no pushovers and they are giving a very clear indication of what they are capable of here. england completely pinned down and the pressure is mounting on them.
ireland vs england live score: four! beautiful from brook
first boundary for england in 17 balls. he lofts hand over mid-off sumptuously for that. england need a lot more of those.
t20 world cup live score: england 48/3 in 8 overs
ireland have got england utterly pinned down now, their require run rate is over 9 and they are going at just over 6.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: bowled him! stokes falls to a beauty!
oh that has to be among the contenders for ball of the tournament, fionn hand with an unplayable delivery to get england's star all-rounder. lands on a length, jags in and goes between bat and pad to take the stumps. absolute peach of a delivery, england in all sorts at the moment.
stokes b hand 6 (8), 29/3 in 5.1 overs
ireland vs england live score: england 28/2 in 5 overs
slow and steady at the moment from ben stokes and dawid malan. england have been left rattled in this powerplay and this is far from the slap bang tactic that we are so used to seeing from them. stokes is on six off seven, malan on 13 off 16.
t20 world cup live score: out! this time it's hales!
little has got ireland off to a brilliant start here. waist high short ball, hales goes for the pull but only gets a top edge. it is then an easy catch for fine leg. hales had been saved by a rather harsh dropped catch off the previous ball and was beaten on the ball before that.
hales c adair b little 7 (5), england 14/2 in 2.4 overs
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: gone! buttler falls!
well what a start for ireland! width and angling away from buttler, the ball takes his inside edge and wicketkeeper tucker pouches it. big, big early wicket.
buttler c tucker b little 0 (2), england 0/1 in 0.2 overs
ireland vs england live score: the players are back!
here are openers jos buttler and alex hales. josh little has the ball in his hands.
t20 world cup live score: mark wood 3/34, is unhappy with his performance
here he is speaking to nasser hussain. “i don’t think i bowled that well, i struggled a bit because it was wet and greasy, was worried about my landings. a bit flat for the first 10 overs, but then liam livingstone came in and did the job. i think we have a score we should be able to chase now. we gave away too many boundary balls, and they used the big stadium to run a lot of twos. i think we could have done better as a bowling unit to restrict them under 157. the body is feeling good, i’m happy with the pace i’m able to generate.”
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: ireland all out for 157
they would consider themselves about 50 runs behind where they could have got had they gone through the death overs the way they did for the rest of the innings. that last wicket was the seventh to fall in the last five overs for just 40 runs, so it is pretty much a disaster for ireland.
ireland vs england live score: bowled him!
full and straight from curran, bull's eye right on the base of middle stump. ireland's collapse continues.
mccarthy b curran 3 (3), ireland 152/8 in 18.2 overs
t20 world cup live score: gone! ireland crumbling at the death
slog-sweep that doesn't travel and livingstone gets his third. ireland will be pretty disappointed with the way they are ending this innings.
adair c curran b livingstone 4 (4), ireland 149/7 in 17.5 overs
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: out! campher falls!
it looked like that might go down as a wide but buttler celebrates and the umpire raises his finger. replays show that campher had got a proper inside edge on the attempted pull shot for the short ball that went down the leg side.
curtis campher c buttler b wood 17 (11), ireland 138/6 in 16.3 overs
ireland vs england live score: four! brilliant from campher!
campher just uses the breakneck speed provided by wood and helps it over of the wicketkeeper's head for a four behind.
t20 world cup live score: gone! two in two for livingstone
well, well livingstone is on a hat-trick! he has yorked dockrell first ball and the batter simply was not expecting that.
dockrell b livingstone 0 (1), ireland 132/4 in 15.4 overs
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: out! balbirnie falls!
sweep shot and this time the ireland captain perishes. sweeps livingstone but he can't clear that gigantic boundary, alex hales pouches it about 20m inside the line.
balbirnie c hales b livingstone 62 (47), ireland 132/4 in 15.3 overs
ireland vs england live score: six! what a shot from balbirnie!
don't let balbirnie pull, he is just too good at that shot. absolute nails the shot off a short one from curran off the third ball of the 13th. the ball goes into the stands where a fan attempts a diving catch, ends up with his hairy legs sticking out over the sea of seats. he gets up eventually and bows down as the rest of the stand laughs and cheers. good fun all-round, all of it started by a simply sensational shot from the ireland captain. what an innings he is playing.
t20 world cup live score: 50 for balbirnie
the skipper has led from the front so far. works the ball to square leg off rashid's third ball of the 12th over to take a single and get to the mark.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: concussion test for campher
campher hits the third ball of the over for four after wood had sent one wide. the next ball, obviously is pitched in wood's half of the pitch and it hits campher on the grill. he seems okay but the concussion test happens anyhow, rightly enough.
ireland vs england live score: out! tector gone for a duck!
well when it rains, it pours. we saw that literally earlier in the day and england are now experiencing it metaphorically. good captaincy from buttler, bringing on dangerman wood as the new batter comes in and the pacer delivers. 15kph bolt that goes away from tector just that little bit outside off, the bat's outside edge and buttler's gloves doe the rest.
tector c buttler b wood 0 (2), ireland 103/3 in 12.2 overs
t20 world cup live score: gone! something from nothing for england!
that is quite unlucky but sharp work from rashid. balbirnie hits the last ball of the 12th over straight down the ground, rashid is quick to get down to his right and gets his fingers on the ball before it hits the wickets at the non-striker's end. tucker was hopelessly off the crease and he is gone. the partnership ends at 82 runs.
tucker run out (rashid) 34 (27), ireland 92/2 in 12 overs
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: 100 up for ireland!
it has come in just 11.2 overs. so far so good for ireland. buttler was forced to bring in livingstone for the 11th over and now rashid is in for the 12th. england just looking for a wicket from somewhere.
ireland vs england live score: six! what an over this is for ireland!
short and towards leg side from woakes, balbirnie pulls fine and this time the ball goes all the way. one run off the next ball and that makes it 18 runs off the 10th over. ireland 92/1, balbirnie 41 (29), tucker 30 (23).
t20 world cup live score: four! balbirnie turning it on
second four of the 10th over, this one off the fourth ball. he comes down the track and pulls it over square leg, ball takes a bounce and goes over the boundary. the first four came off the first ball after balbirnie pulled it very fine.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: stokes returns
buttler trying to find a way to break this stand but stokes at least has stemmed the flow of runs. just four off the eighth and the stand moves to 48 off 34. ireland are 69/1.
ireland vs england live score: six! ireland 59/1 in 6 overs
well this has turned into a fantastic powerplay for ireland. tucker converts a length ball from curran into practically a half volley by charging down the pitch and neatly lifts the ball over the bowler's head and into the stands.
t20 world cup live score: balbirnie receives medical attention
the ireland captain fends off the first delivery of the fifth from wood and takes a rap on his finger. the medic is out for this one.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: wood torpedoes
mark wood was consistently bowling at 149kph or more in that third over, with one of his deliveries touching a mind-numbing 154kph. he returns to bowl the fifth, ireland are 37/1.
ireland vs england live score: out! wood gets the breakthrough!
another top edge but this time, it is gobbled up by curran at deep third. wood is sending in rockets here and england get their first wicket.
stirling c curran b wood 14 (8), ireland 22/1 in 2.3 overs
t20 world cup live score: six! stirling withe first six!
stirling miscues an attempted slap over the infield but such is the pace from wood that the top edges flies over the deep third man fielder for a six. sam curran tried to palm it in and and it looked like he may have succeeded but the replays show that he had crossed the boundary before letting go of the ball.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: four! balbirnie ends the over well
gives himself room and lifts the ball over the offside and that is the ireland captain's first boundary. ireland continue being positive despite the swing, the score is 15/0 after 2 overs.
ireland vs england live score: the players take the field, again
no overs lost yet, woakes will continue the second over and stirling will take strike once again. let's see how long this period of play lasts.

well, some of the covers are being folded up. let us see if this is only a false dawn or if this will lead to some sustained action.

ireland vs england live score: just 3 runs off first over
a lot of swing for stokes and chris woakes who is coming in to bowl the second. stokes brings back the last ball sharply and it takes
t20 world cup live score: the players are out!
right then, the rain has cleared decisively and the players run onto the pitch. paul stirling is on strike for ireland with captain balbirnie at the other end. england continue with their tactic of getting ben stokes to bowl the first over.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: scratch that! the rain is back
the sheets are back on the pitch, the umpires are standing there without their umbrellas but it is drizzling again. this might be a bit of stop start affair. the england players are fully kitted up and sitting in their dugouts though so they all expect this delay to not last too long.
ireland vs england live score: play to start in 10 minutes
rain has stopped and the covers are being removed. no overs lost so far and for now, the status is that play will begin in 10 minutes. keep your fingers crossed.
t20 world cup live score: start delayed
both teams walk off the field after the national anthem, instead of england staying on and going into a huddle after it, and mike atherton says on air that there is a “slight delay”. no further updates.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: raindrops on the trophy
here is the rain that had been forecast earlier, appearing just as the two teams lineup for their national anthems. just a slight drizzle at the moment and no word on whether it has caused any delays. the t20 world cup trophy has got a few drops on its spotless, shiny body.
ireland vs england live score: the mcg
this colosseum was absolutely heaving with people the last time it hosted match in this tournament. today, there are people but it's a scattered population, just a handful compared to the multitudes that can be hosted in these stands.
t20 world cup live score: ireland captain andy balbirnie
“we would have wanted to chase as well with the rain around. the message has been clear, we back our plans and try to create some special memories for our fans. (on 2011 win) there are two guys in our group who were part of the u19 world cup that same year, so there's always hope that we can replicate something similar. one change for us - fionn hand comes in for simi singh.”
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: what jos buttler said
“we're going to bowl first. a bit unsure about the weather so we are going to bowl first. lots of these grounds in australia are huge, so fielding is a big part of our preparation. yes, we play two games in three days here, but we want to stick to our best playing combinations, hence no changes.”
ireland vs england live score: the pitch
the weather in melbourne has been quite strange today. there was forecast of thunderstorm and rain all day but there was only a slight drizzle and it is quite clear for now. isa guha said that the teams will look to the deeper parts of the ground to curb run scoring because of the rain in the morning. shane watson then said that the wicket looks nice for a fast bowler, there is green grass along with the dry grass which will give seam movement. there is more bounce because of the moisture.

england have won the toss and chosen to bowl first. buttler says that the uncertainty around the weather has played a role in his decision.
t20 world cup live score: england's top problems
england's batting lineup seemed to be playing cricket in a different universe during the last t20 world cup. however, things couldn't be more different during their opening match of this tournament against afghanistan. sam curran's extraordinary five-wicket haul had helped them dismiss afghanistan for 112 runs but their batting lineup made a real mess of what could have been some sweet net run rate juice for them. 16 overs into their innings, england had lost half their batters and had just edged over the 100-run mark. the top four has names like jos buttler, alex hales, dawid malan and ben stokes and they would be hoping that they can live up to them starting from today.
ire vs eng live t20 world cup: back at the 'g
this is the first match that the mcg is hosting in this tournament since there was that little game between india and pakistan a couple of days ago. you would remember that one, a quietish game with nearly 100,000 spectators cheering every single minor and major event and ended with a nice little innings from this little known player called virat kohli. that match has put a very high standard on this tournament, with australia's mitch marsh saying that they should just end the world cup right there. let's hope we get something today even remotely close to the drama we saw the last time the 'g hosted a 2022 t20 world cup game.
ireland vs england live score: hello and welcome!
england were a mixed bag in their first match. they would be happy that sam curran, someone who has emerged as an x-factor for them with bat and ball over the past few years in all formats, continues to have that kind of effect on matches. but they would be concerned that they needed an exceptional performance from him to win this match and that their much heralded top ordered didn't do much.
