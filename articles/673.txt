after his swashbuckling knock, suryakumar said, "in t20, a hundred is always special but at the same time, it was really important for me to bat till the very end. hardik was telling me to bat till the 18th or 19th over, and get to a score of 185 or so. after the end of the 16th over, we had a chat about taking it deep. it was important to maximise the last few overs. have been doing the same things over and over again, in the nets and it's just coming off for me."
chasing a target of 192 runs, new zealand were bowled out for 126 in 18.5 overs, with deepak hooda bagging a four-wicket haul. meanwhile, mohammed siraj and yuzvendra chahal took two wickets each. kane williamson top-scored for the hosts with a knock of 61 runs off 52 balls.
