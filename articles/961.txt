â€œi want a rematch between india and pakistan. but i think pakistan will repeat history in 2022. jaise 1992 ka world cup jeetey they, new zealand ko harakey final mein phochey they, waise he mujhey lagta hai england india ko phainta lagakey, wo phoch jayga final mein, aur phir hum unko harakey world cup leke wapis ajayngey. (i do want a rematch between india and pakistan but i think history will repeat itself in 2022. like how pakistan won the 1992 world cup, by defeating new zealand to enter the final, england will beat india to enter the summit clash. and then we (pakistan team) will beat england in the final to take home the world cup trophy)," akhtar told ary news.
the former pakistani pacer and full-time cricket pundit also asserted that england will crush team india if the buttler-led side ended up batting second in the second semi-final. "india chase krega (team india would like to chase in the semi-final). england also somehow suffer from pressure. i reckon england batting second will destroy india, whoever chases it, i don't know, i think it will be much easier to win the game. isme sabsey zyada maza kisko ayga - icc aur broadcaster ko! (this match will be a treat for icc and the official broadcaster of the world cup)," akhtar added.
