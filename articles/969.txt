india vs england semi-final, t20 world cup 2022 live streaming: a berth in the final will be at stake when india and england lock horns in adelaide on thursday. india come to the game after finishing at the top of their group in the super 12 stage with eight points, while england qualified for the semi-final after registering a win in their final group game of the stage against sri lanka last week. the winner of the match will take on pakistan in the final at the iconic melbourne cricket ground; the babar azam-led side had defeated new zealand in the first semi-final by 7 wickets in sydney.
rohit sharma's men will be aiming for a rematch of their opening game of the tournament in melbourne, as they take on england in adelaide. on a pitch that has been relatively slower than other surfaces in this world cup, india might be slight favourites due to their spin strength, with ravichandran ashwin and axar patel being among the wickets over the past few matches. the side did endure injury scares to their star batters rohit sharma and virat kohli in the build-up to the game, but no major concern has been reported. england, meanwhile, have been nervy with their batting department but alex hales' valiant knock in the match against sri lanka (47 off 30 balls), providing the side with a much-needed boost ahead of the semi-final clash against india.
