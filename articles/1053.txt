“there was that kind of thinking that potentially it was going to be a different result but the moment that pakistan cricket fires off with intent and starts to reveal its teeth, they become a real threat. there will be no one in this world, in this competition that would want to face us right now, not one. they thought that they got rid of us. now, they're not going to get rid of us,” hayden said in a video shared by pakistan cricket on sunday.
