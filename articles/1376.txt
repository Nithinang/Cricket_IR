pakistan captain babar azam produced a stunning effort on the field, taking an incredible catch to dismiss zimbabwe's regis chakabwa in the t20 world cup match on thursday. standing at first slip for spinner shadab khan, babar perfectly judged a thick outside edge off chakabwa, as he took a dive to his left and managed to grab hold of the ball. even the pakistan captain himself was stunned following the catch, as his teammates gathered around babar to congratulate him.
zimbabwe had been posing some problems for pakistan during the middle overs of the match but shadab's 14th over of the innings turned the tables; the spinner took two successive wickets on the fifth and sixth ball, while mohammad wasim took two more wickets off consecutive deliveries in the next over as zimbabwe lost four batters without a run added to the total.
