the indian women's team recently won the asia cup in bangladesh, beating sri lanka in the final at sylhet by 8 wickets. they also won india's first-ever medal in cricket at the commonwealth games in birmingham earlier this year. the harmanpreet kaur-led side lost to australia in the final and got silver.
ever since india's performance in the 2017 women's odi world cup in england, where they lost to the hosts in the final, the popularity of women's cricket has seen an unprecedented rise in the country.
bcci, in its last agm in mumbai earlier this month, has also announced the first-ever women's ipl next year with five teams.
earlier this year, new zealand cricket (nzc) had struck a deal with the country's players' association, which enabled the women cricketers to earn as much as the mail players, while cricket australia (ca) is also working to do away with gender disparity.
