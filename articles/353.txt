pakistan fast bowler hasan ali lost his temper and almost engaged in a physical altercation with the crowd during a local cricket match. in videos that have gone viral on social media, the 28-year-old can be seen being being heckled by the crowd and later getting into a physical altercation.
among the things the crowd can be heard shouting at hasan was that he is not part of the pakistan squad. they were also taunting him over a crucial catch that he had dropped during pakistan's 2021 t20 world cup semi-final against australia. the player seemed to have finally lost his cool and and pounced on the crowd. organisers can be seen intervening and pulling hasan away. according to pakistan media, hasan was playing a match on sunday in arif wala, a city in the pakpattan district of the country's punjab province.
