"it has to do a lot with helping myself to go back to the basics and approaching everything on a positive note," pandya said. "because of that i have got peace in my life looking at the brighter side always. i know i will have good days and bad days but the positivity comes from the hard work that i put in, which then gives me the self-belief and confidence to give it everything. and with the support of my family to always have my back, i feel a sense of complete focus and positivity around me."

while pandya has always worked doubly hard to get fitter, he credited his family for allowing him to go one step further during the last year or so.
"this time the difference was that my family played a big role in terms of letting me be myself. more than anything, letting me have my own time to realize what exactly i want for myself," he said. "the credit goes to natasha, agastya, krunal - everyone kind of allowed me to maintain my routine and made sure [to realize] that you know what, hardik right now should focus on himself and he should keep himself as a priority. and because of that, i was able to understand a lot of things which i had kind of forgotten over the years while playing because there are certain things you donâ€™t write down, it just happens. but because of the support from my family i was able to know this without again experiencing - it was just remembering that, okay, at that point of time i used to feel this, this point of time i used to feel this," he said.
