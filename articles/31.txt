the official twitter handle of the international cricket council (icc) was brutally trolled for a massive blunder during india's meeting with bangladesh in the series decider on wednesday. after losing the series opener to the hosts, rohit sharma-led team india squared off against mehidy hasan miraz-starrer bangladesh in the second odi of the bilateral series at the shere bangla national stadium.
bangladesh skipper litton das won the toss and the hosts opted to bat first in the series decider. sharing an update about the coin toss in dhaka, the world governing body of cricket ended up making an unfortunate gaffe on twitter. the icc posted a photo of the canadian cricket team while sharing the toss update about the 2nd odi between bangladesh and india. taking cognisance of the now-deleted post, netizens called out icc as the world governing body was mercilessly trolled on the microblogging site.
