former indian captain mohammad azharuddin became a laughing stock on twitter for issuing a clarification tweet about virat kohli and ashish nehra's throwback photo after rishi sunak was named as the leader of britain's governing conservative party. for the unversed, sunak's appointment as the new leader of the conservative party has triggered a hilarious meme fest on social media.
from throwback photos of nehra and kohli to 'kohinoor memes', netizens quickly saw the funny side of the significant development after sunak was picked as britain's third prime minister in 2022. recently, a twitter user posted an old photo of former cricketer nehra, who many believe looks like the doppelganger of sunak. at a time when the 'young kohli with sunak' photo became an instant hit on social media, azharuddin shared a noteworthy post and said that kohli is not snapped with ukâ€™s new prime minister.
