fresh from a memorable campaign at the t20 world cup 2022 in australia, premier batter suryakumar yadav will remain in the spotlight as team india is set to meet new zealand in their first away assignment after the icc event on friday. suryakumar, who made his world cup debut in 2021, emerged as one of the most impactful players for the rohit sharma-led side in the 2022 edition of the showpiece event.
the premier batter is expected to spearhead the batting charge of the hardik pandya-led side in the absence of seasoned campaigners and some of the biggest names in world cricket. india will miss the services of captain rohit sharma, vice-captain kl rahul and batting icon virat kohli in the three-match series against hosts new zealand.
