the former england cricketer had got jaffer out in the fourth innings of the lord's test in 2002 as jaffer had edged the ball to then england captain nasser hussain at slips. it was vaughan's wicket in a test match.
as vaughan's tweet got viral, cricket fans waited for a savage reply from jaffer, who is known for his meme filled witty tweets. and indeed, jaffer replied in his trademark style. he shared a meme of comic character hulk holding burnol, an ointment used to treat minor burns.
